Make sure you have Janus, Gstreamer, and dependencies installed.
When installing Janus, enable websockets.
The .jcfg files are new config files for Janus implementation. They can be found at /opt/janus/etc/janus once you have Janus installed.
There are still some problems with the test website (index.html) but its able to be viewed through the Janus streaming demo.



run:

To test GStreamer: "gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! video/x-raw,colorimetry=bt709,format=NV12,width=1280,height=720,framerate=30/1 ! videoconvert ! vp8enc deadline=1 ! rtpvp8pay pt=96 ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5000"
To run Janus: "/opt/janus/bin/janus"

cd into Soccer-Robots/streaingTesting/janus-gateway/html
To test webpages: "python -m http.server 8080"

For problems regarding the port, cd into /opt/janus/etc/janus
vim into janus.plugin.streaming.jcfg

I would recommend opening new terminals for each to see the logs.
