Main objective was to come up with goalpost design, so I created 2.

### goalpost.SLDPRT
- Simplified design of Su25, made bigger about 15in wide to accommodate ball and bigger robots.
- Box style design, ball exits on the side
- Main concern: ramp may not be steep enough to let ball roll to the side
- NEEDS TESTING for the above design to ensure ball does roll
- Maybe get a better ball or treat ramp surface??
### goalpost_alt.SLDPRT
- Very similar to previous, however ball exits from the back
- Ramps are steeper to shouldn't have an issue with ball rolling
- Main concern: ball exits through the center back, how do we reliably get it to the launch mechanism and go out the front???
### 3D Printing
- Need to 3D print one of these, Bambu Studio has tools to break this into parts but need to familiarize myself
- Also need a 3D printer, EPICS lab one is kind of small so try to get access to something else to speed things up
### launcher_assembly.SLDASM
- Uses a "flywheel" to launch the ball, much like tennis ball launchers
- The "wheel" in this model is a LEGO 56x26 tire, part number 55976
